# The Witcher 3 Ultimate

## What is this?

There's something magical about CDPR's worlds that makes me just want to visit them. The Witcher 3 is one of my favourite games, especially the Blood and Wine DLC. ANd after a year of not playing, I missed the world. So I decided to play again.

However, I decided to mod a bunch of things to fix things that bug me, while really focusing on keeping (and improving) all the elements that for me make it a magical world I want to stay in.

This has taken a lot of trying different mods, experimenting, and fixing conflicts between mods (The Witcher 3 is notoriously fiddly to mod). So I figured I'd share my results here, so that if you want to just jump in to a modded game, you can.

## Contributing

I am always happy to receive help, constructive feedback, and suggestions! especially on the [TODO](https://github.com/sammilucia/witcher3ultimate/blob/main/README.md#todo) items below! ðŸ˜Š

## TODO

- Get BlitzFX running on Linux ðŸ˜¥ (you can use everything else on Linux, just not BlitzFX yet). Crashdummy in the asus-linux.org discord suggested trying `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="d3d11=n" %command%` to Steam but I haven't had a chance to try it yet
- Geralt kind of shuffles instead of walks. I haven't worked out why!
- Sheep look AWFUL. There is a mod but it just makes them look fake.
- I'd like Geralt to look paler (while still having a less red scar). Everyone comments how awful you look (but 

## Kudos
I will credit all mod authors and link to their mods. While I've put in days of my time and manually fixed some conflicts, ultimately they did the biggest part of the work, and this would not exist without not just the mods these authors made, but also often the mods that came before them that they improved upon. Not to mention the fantastic work of CDPR, who made one of the best games (imo) of all time, with such incredible voice acting, and so much love and thought behind it.

I will keep the mod download private until I have time to properly credit all authors (and ask their permission where requested).

## What I didn't do...

Mods that are too "obvious" are not usedâ€”some mods look amazing, but are just too much. For example, there are some great clouds mods, but then all you notice is the clouds (they overpower the rest of the game). I didn't use High Quality Faces. It's not required with the Lip Movement and Hires Shadows mod (and does nothing if both are installed). In instances where there are a few mod choices, I tried them all and chose the ones that fit the world best.

Most importantly, in some cases, I chose to use _no_ mods at all. Why? This is not a "mod everything that can be modded" modpack. It's a very carefully picked group of mods. While some mods like HD Oaks, Darker Generic Trees, Rustic Pines, HD Monsters, and HD Animals are technically more realistic or improved, I felt the world started to lose its fantasy feel, and I enjoyed it less. So there are many mods that are left out.

## New Hotkeys 'n' stuff

There are some new hotkeys and things to know in the game now:

- Go to the Options > Mods menu, you can tune many of the mods to your liking ðŸ˜Š
- Press 'N' to use Axii during Gwent (and automatically win). Why? Some people don't like to play Gwent, but I still want to collect all the cards and finish all the quests
- Double tap LShift to sprint harder
- Use Witcher Sense to see your map
- Use Backspace to toggle the HUD off and on

## The mods used are (I've probably missed some, I'll reconcile these later):

### Game

- Thousands of bug and quest fixes (Witcher 3 - Redux, Brothers in Arms, NPC Script Fixes, Immersive Sound, Rend Adrenaline Fix, Fix Duplicate Merchant)
- Lootingâ€”by default you can steal everything (like in Cyberpunk 2077). You can changeg this in the Mods menus. Looting will now also loot all close-by containers at once, so it's less tedious and more fun (Convenient Looting Redux)
- Looting herbs, you now don't have to go into the herb menu, and will get 1â€“3 of that herb (Enhanced Herbalism). The downside of this is, without the HUD on, it's now very difficult to know which herb is which, which does bother me if anyone can think of a workaround

### Engine

- There is an entirely new lighting and shadows 3D engine (BlitzFX)
- Textures are significantly upgraded (and sometimes 3D meshes, too) across the board (HD Reworked, 4K Clutter, HD Horse Accessories, HD Tree LOD Billboards, HD Armour, HD Chainmail, Whites, Unique Eyes for All Witchers, HQ Ciri Eyes)
- The level of detail is basically forced to "ultra" always now (Next Gen LOD, Hairworks 60fps FIX and LOD Increase, Increased Draw Distance, Increased Draw Distance for Toussaint
- Faces always use their highest level of detail models (Lip Movement and Hires Shadows)

### People

- Yen's makeup is less overdone, she has purple eyes (per the books), her face shape is softer, and hair and clothes are more feminine. Yen is essentially reworked to look prettier, and a little less man-like (which imo makes her a lot more dangerous)
- Triss's makeup and face are reworked to make her look younger (she is quite young), though she still has fairly heavy makeup. Why? She's young and still finding herself. Here eye colour was changed per the books (Blue Eyes for Triss)
- Many key females are tweaked. For some reason in the original game, so many women have really heavy eye makeup. I've chosen mods to better suit their characters. E.g. Chani wears little makeup, she is very no-fuss and straight to work type.
- By the same thinking, Cerys an Craite was left alone. Her dark eye makeup is like war paint to her. For this reason I also left Fringilla alone.
- Lighter makeup was used for Corinne, Rosa and Edna, Shani, Syanna, Anna Henrietta (El's Custom Complexions)
- Vivienne de Tabris has a tweaked appearance (El's Custom Complexions)
- Iris von Everec's dark makeup I left alone, because she's more spooky that way. I also thought, she's trying so hard to get  Olgierd's attention, so it seemed kind of fitting (and tragic) she goes so far with her looks.
- Philippa Eilhart's bruising around her eyes is less severe. She's a sorceress, she was able to heal that (but not get her eyes back). Besides, not having eyes makes her more shocking, which she prefers.
- Geralt's scars are less red (so it looks like he's had them a longer)
- Geralt's hair is improved (Geralt Enhanced Wind Effect HairWorks)
- Geralt's face and hair now becomes wet in rain and after swimming (HW Hair Wetness Fix, Dynamic Wet Face)
- Geralt now has penis. It's only visible momentarily in a few cutscenes, but looks better than a conspicuous blank spot!

### Animals/Monsters

- I chose not to use HD Animals or HD Monsters, while they add sharper textures, I don't necessarily think they're "better".
- Most animals have hairworks fur now (Hairworks on Everything, Better Vanilla Fur)
- Roach's tail and mane is now hairworks (Roach Hairworks Tail)
- Roach can now go in deep water, and can gallop in cities. She may also jump off a cliff if you make her, so be careful (Better Roach Control)

### World

- When it comes to sky/cloud mods, I haven't used any. The reason is, I felt (while all of them look amazing), they draw too much attention to the sky, and _away_ from the rest of the
- I haven't used the Beautiful Meadows mod. While I agree it looks amazing, it makes the grass the same through most of the game, which makes the differences between each area a lot less. Instead I've turned up the grass density, and the existing grass textures are tweaked
- Lighting is now a lot more realistic and amazing (New Lightning Effect)
- You can now fast travel from almost anywhere. This shouldn't break quests (but perhaps be careful if you're right in the thick of a quest) (Bug Fixed Fast Travel)

### Combat/Movement

- There were a lot of broken abilities and problems with the vanilla combat. These have all been addressed and the combat scaling overhauled (Witcher 3 - Redux)
- The starting weapons are now the ending weapons from Witcher 2 (Witcher 3 - Redux)
- You will feel more powerful and competent, like a Witcher should. At the same time, the enemies will feel a lot more dangerous, and some of them are significantly faster
- You no longer run out of stamina (only to have it immediately restored) while "sprinting". ("Sprinting is more of a "jog" imo.) (Advanced Sprint)
- There are now animations for a range of activities such as taking potions, oiling swords, eating and drinking. Careful! If you decide to oil your sword mid-combat because you haven't plannedâ€”you might not be able to! (Complete Animations Redux). I didn't use looting animations, because you already go into the looting screen, which felt adequate

### Witcher Stuff
- Cat is now more believable, it doesn't highlight enemies, and is not so crazy bright (Darker Cat, Cat Potion No Enemy Glow)
